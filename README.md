# DevRel Workshop - OpenTelemetry with New Relic

OpenTelemetry, often referred to as OTel for short, is a vendor-neutral open-source observability framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces). As an industry standard steadily gaining in popularity, it is natively supported by a number of observability vendors including New Relic.

In this workshop, you will get hands-on experience with an application that can leverage the FluentBit, OpenTelemetry, and Kubernetes stack. You will instrument the application and interact directly with several core components of OpenTelemetry.
